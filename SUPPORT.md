# Support for CANOE transportation (Alpha Release)

Thank you for trying out the CANOE transportation project in its early alpha stage!
At this point, we are focusing on gathering feedback, fixing bugs, and shaping the project for a stable release.

## How to Get Help

- **Questions**: Please open a GitHub Issue with the question label.

- **Bugs**: Open a GitHub Issue with the bug label. Include as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, environment, error messages).

- **Feature Requests**: Use the enhancement label in Issues. We may not implement everything right away, but your ideas help guide our roadmap.

## What to Expect

- Response times may be slower during alpha as we prioritize critical bug fixes.

- Breaking changes may occur between releases â€” APIs and file formats are not yet stable.

- Pull requests are not yet accepted for major code contributions. For now, we encourage bug reports and feature requests only.
